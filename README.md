# Online Food Management System

## Overview

This project introduces an advanced online food management system that aims to transform the food delivery industry by addressing challenges present in current applications. The system revolutionizes the ordering process for customers, streamlines restaurant operations, and optimizes delivery processes.

### Problem Statement

Existing online food applications face several challenges:
- Limited restaurant options
- Complex ordering interfaces
- Restricted payment methods
- Ineffective feedback mechanisms

### Proposed Solution

Our system addresses these challenges by offering:
- Enhanced restaurant selection
- Intuitive user interface
- Flexible payment options
- Efficient feedback mechanisms

## User Profiles and Requirements

The system caters to three main user profiles: Customer, Restaurant, and Rider, providing specific functionalities for each.

- **Customer:** Browsing menus, placing orders, tracking orders, rating, and reviewing.
- **Restaurant:** Receiving orders, preparing and packaging orders, maintaining standards, and notifying the system when orders are ready.
- **Rider:** Accepting/viewing orders, navigating, communicating, and ensuring food safety during delivery.

## Usage of Data Structures and Algorithms

The system utilizes various data structures and algorithms for efficient operations:
- Queue for order management
- Hashing for storing restaurant and rider details
- Doubly linked list for menu representation
- Merge sort for sorting orders
- Stack for managing delivery orders
- Priority queue for processing paid orders
- Hashing for secure user account storage
- Hashing or BST for efficient searching operations

## Conclusion

The proposed system aims to create a seamless and enjoyable food delivery experience for all stakeholders involved, improving the ordering process, restaurant efficiency, and delivery personnel's capabilities.
